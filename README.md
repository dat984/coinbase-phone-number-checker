# Coinbase Phone Number Validator

This Python script checks if a given phone number is associated with a Coinbase account. It simulates a verification attempt by observing Coinbase's responses, without logging into the account or accessing sensitive information. The script includes error handling, rate-limiting considerations, and retry logic to improve reliability and avoid detection.

## Features

- **Retry Logic**: Retries requests up to a maximum limit if they fail or are rate-limited.
- **Rate Limiting**: Includes random delays to mimic human-like behavior and avoid rate-limiting.
- **Error Handling**: Handles network errors, unexpected status codes, and Coinbase rate limits.
- **Detailed Output**: Provides clear output indicating the status of each verification attempt.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

## Setup

1. **Install required libraries**

   Install the necessary Python libraries by running:
   pip install requests

2. **Configure API Endpoint and Headers**

   The script uses a placeholder endpoint and a header for phone validation. Modify as needed based on Coinbase's security settings.

## Usage

Run the script using:

py coinbase_phone_validator.py

You will be prompted to enter a phone number. The script will then attempt to verify if the phone number is recognized by Coinbase.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The script prompts the user for a phone number.
2. **Request Handling**: The script simulates a phone verification request.
3. **Rate-Limiting Management**: Random delays help avoid being rate-limited by Coinbase.
4. **Response Interpretation**: Based on Coinbase's response, the script infers if the phone number is associated with a Coinbase account.

## Example Output

Enter the phone number to check if it has a Coinbase account: +1234567890
Checking if '+1234567890' is associated with a Coinbase account...
Delaying request by 2.37 seconds.
The phone number does not appear to be recognized by Coinbase.

This output means the provided phone number is likely not recognized by Coinbase, based on the server's response.
